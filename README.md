   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaai-ai/lab.git
   ```

Our organizational structure is the following: First, we have parent directories categorized by area, such as `large-language-models`, `time-series-forecasting`, `recommender-systems`, etc. Inside each of these parent directories, there is a second level consisting of individual directories for each article. These article directories contain all the necessary dependencies and instructions related to that specific experiment, ensuring they are self-contained.
